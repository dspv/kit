# Start Kit for AI Self Coder

> **🤖 Development Starter Kit** | Ready-to-use templates for AI-powered project development

## 🎯 What is this?

This repository contains **standardized development guidelines** and **project templates** designed specifically for AI agents and human developers working together.

**Main Purpose:**
- 🚀 **Quick project bootstrap** - Copy `START.md` to any new repo and begin development
- 🤖 **AI agent guidelines** - Clear rules for autonomous development under human supervision  
- 📊 **Consistent tracking** - Standardized README structure for project monitoring
- 🔄 **GitSpecOps approach** - Repository state always reflects project truth

---

## 📋 How to Use

### For New Projects
1. **Copy `START.md`** to your new empty repository
2. **Give task to AI agent:** "Build X feature with Y functionality"  
3. **AI reads START.md** and follows all development guidelines
4. **After first commit:** AI migrates `START.md` → `/spec/GUIDE.md`
5. **Monitor progress** through structured README with progress bars

### For Existing Projects  
- All guidelines should already be in `/spec/` folder
- AI agents must read `/spec/GUIDE.md` before starting work
- README must follow tracking structure from guidelines

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

```
/kit/
├── START.md          # Main development guidelines template
└── README.md         # This file
```

**Coming Soon:**

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

```bash
# 1. Create new project
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project
git init

# 2. Copy starter template  
cp ~/dev/kit/START.md .

# 3. Give task to AI agent
# "Build a REST API for user management with authentication"

# 4. AI reads START.md and begins development
# 5. Monitor progress through README updates
```
